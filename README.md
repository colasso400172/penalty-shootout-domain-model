  <h2>Penalty Domain Model (Smalltalk)</h2>
  <p>
    Object-Oriented modeling of a football penalty shootout system developed in Smalltalk.
  </p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project implements the domain logic of a penalty shootout game,
    modeling interactions between players (Striker and Goalkeeper),
    shot direction, force calculation and scoring rules.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pure Object-Oriented design</li>
    <li>Encapsulation of game rules and domain logic</li>
    <li>Unit testing using TestCase</li>
    <li>Clear separation of responsibilities between entities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technologies</h3>
